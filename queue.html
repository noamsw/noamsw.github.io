            <h2>Queue – The epitome of a FIFO data structure</h2>
            <p>The Queue is the most classic example of a FIFO - First In First Out, data structure. <br>
                The Queue is a linear data structures that models real world queues, wherein elements are added to the back of the queue, and removed from the front. <br> 
                This is why it is considered FIFO, the first element added is the first element removed. <br><br>
                An ADT of stacks commonly includes these four methods:<br>
                <ul class="disc-list">
                    <li><strong>enqueue(element)</strong> – a method which adds a single element to the back of the queue, O(1)<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>dequeue()</strong> – a method which removes a single element from the front of the queue, O(1)<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>peek()</strong> - a method which returns the topmost element of the stack, without removal, O(1)<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>isEmpty()</strong> -  a method which returns true if the queue is empty <br><br></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The following link includes my implementation of a stack in cpp, including a header file, a source file and a small test file:
