            <h2>Stack – The epitome of a LIFO data structure</h2>
            <p>The stack is the most classic example of a LIFO – Last In, First Out data structure.<br> The stack is used for many different applications in computer science. 
                A stack is a one-ended linear DS, that models real world stacks, wherein elements are added and removed to the top of the pile.<br> 
                This is why it is considered LIFO, the last element added is the first element removed.<br><br>
                An ADT of stacks commonly includes these five methods:<br>
                <ul class="disc-list">
                    <li><strong>Push()</strong> -  a method which adds a single element to the top of the stack, O(1)<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>Pop()</strong> -  a method which removes the topmost element from the stack, O(1)<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>Peek()</strong> - a method which returns the topmost element of the stack, without removal, O(1)<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>Size()</strong> – a method which returns the number of elements currently in the stack, O(1)<br><br></li>
                    <li>depending on the implementation chosen, another common method is:<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>IsFull()</strong> -  a method which returns true if the stack is filled to capacity, O(1)<br><br></li>
                    <li>My implementation uses a linked list and therefore does not require this method, as we can grow the stack as we wish.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The following link includes my implementation of a stack in cpp, including a header file, a source file and a small test file:
