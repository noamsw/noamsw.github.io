                <h2>Stack</h2>
                <h3>The epitome of a LIFO data structure</p>
                <p>The stack is the most classic example of a LIFO – Last In, First Out data structure.<br> The stack is used for many different applications in computer science. 
                    A stack is a one-ended linear DS, that models real world stacks, wherein elements are added and removed to the top of the pile.<br> 
                    This is why it is considered LIFO, the last element added is the first element removed.<br>
                    An ADT of Stack commonly includes these five methods:
                    <ul class="disc-list">
                        <li><strong>push(element)</strong> -  a method which adds a single element to the top of the stack, O(1)<br><br></li>
                        <li><strong>pop()</strong> -  a method which removes the topmost element from the stack, O(1)<br><br></li>
                        <li><strong>peek()</strong> - a method which returns the topmost element of the stack, without removal, O(1)<br><br></li>
                        <li><strong>size()</strong> – a method which returns the number of elements currently in the stack, O(1)<br><br></li>
                        My implementation uses a linked list and therefore the size of the stack can grow dynamically as we add more elements.<br>
                        However, many basic implementations use arrays, and therefore have a predetermined size.<br>
                        Therefore it is common to have another method, which lets the user know if the stack is full or not:<br><br>
                        <li><strong>isFull()</strong> -  a method which returns true if the stack is filled to capacity, O(1)<br><br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
